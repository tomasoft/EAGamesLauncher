# Introduction
Reason behind the app: I was sick and tired of having to remove and re add C&C mods every time we wanted to play a different one with my son,
due to incompatibilities between various mods.

# Getting Started

Installation process

1. Place the executable anywhere on your computer.
2. Run it and choose the folder with your C&C Generals installations. i.e D:\Program Files\EA Games\The First Decade
3. Run the games by double clicking on the mod names
4. Or by right clicking on the taskbar icon near the clock.

# Contribute

Enjoy!!!
